IMPORTANT NOTES:
Since project2 is built on project1, and project1 has the issue of timing out when sending files above 12.4 MB, the problem persisted when sending data to a buffer.

Please refer to how to run Project1; it is the same process here, except using client2 and server2. 

Many thanks to my partner Chris Wallace.
