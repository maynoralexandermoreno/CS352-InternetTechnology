Important Notes:
The program can open and close correcly.  
It can send one (1) packet of data correctly (during the non-dropping and dropping tests).  
It can send up to about 12.4 MB of data without breaking, but it will break at 12.5 MB and above.  
This is an issue because the graders will use about 90MB. Neither we nor the TA's could find the cause, as it does send multiple packets at a smaller scale.
If cause is found, or solution created, I'll throw it into this folder at a later date.

Many thanks to my partner Chris Wallace.
